       <p class="justify">My all time favorite hobby is dance. I have been doing it since I was 3 and it has made me who I am today. I mainly do ballet, but I have a great passion for modern and contemporary dance. At the age of 13 I went to Ballet West Academy to reecive better training. I am so happy I chose to go to Ballet West because I was able to meet some incredible people, learn from amazing faculty, and grow as an artist.</p>
        
        <div>
       <p class="justify">After being at Ballet West for 2 years, I joined the professional training program. This would mean I would have to give up time at school and put in more hours at dance. With this sacrifice I was blessed in so many ways. It ended up helping my school work, expanding my friendship circle, and allowing me time with my family in the evenings.</p>
